During the journey, Thooku Durai's uncles's Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and reminces his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and a rice mill owner, who uses violent ways to deal with problems.

        While chasing a few goons, Thooku Durai stumbles across a doctor named Niranjana, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he immediately falls for her and he surrenders to the police. but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her field to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he accepts after some consideration. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement in feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the most exceptional pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai.
        
        After their daughter Swetha is born, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights. On the way to pick her from the station, Aavudaiyappan, who is waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Not finding Niranjana at the train station, Thooku Durai finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the child. She leaves the village to the city. After the flashback, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company Niranjana Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd, but to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100 m title.
        
        Swetha travels home when attempts are made to kill her. Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that well-known entrepreneur Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the owner of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of his daughter Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to doping, which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process.
        
        Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. After saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's driver for the next ten days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal about him being her father, to which she reluctantly agrees. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter while saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over by a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and wife. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags during the meet as she has no encouragement.
        
        Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives on the road to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not burden them with what their parents want. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.</P>
